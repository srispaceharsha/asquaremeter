    <h1>Moon Phase Methodology</h1>

    <section class="about-section">
        <p>This project records the moon phase at the time of each sighting. Here's how that works and what it means.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>What We Record</h2>
        <p>For every sighting, I note the moon phase on that calendar day. That's it. I'm not claiming the moon makes bugs appear or disappear. I'm just writing down what phase it was when I saw something.</p>
        <p>Correlation is not causation. If more sightings happen during a Waxing Gibbous moon, it could be random. Or maybe those days had better weather. Or I had more free time. The data shows when things happened together, nothing more.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>How Phases Are Calculated</h2>
        <p>I use a Python library called <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/" target="_blank">PyEphem</a> to calculate moon phases. For each date, it figures out:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How much of the moon is illuminated (0% = new moon, 100% = full moon)</li>
            <li>Whether the moon is waxing (getting brighter) or waning (getting dimmer)</li>
            <li>How many days until the next new moon or full moon</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These numbers determine which of the eight traditional phases applies to that day.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Phase Definitions</h2>
        <p>The eight phases are defined like this:</p>
        <table class="moon-phase-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Phase</th>
                    <th>Condition</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>New Moon</td>
                    <td>Within 1 day of astronomical new moon</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Waxing Crescent</td>
                    <td>Waxing, illumination below 50%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>First Quarter</td>
                    <td>Waxing, illumination between 50% and 55%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Waxing Gibbous</td>
                    <td>Waxing, illumination above 55%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Full Moon</td>
                    <td>Within 1 day of astronomical full moon</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Waning Gibbous</td>
                    <td>Waning, illumination above 55%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Last Quarter</td>
                    <td>Waning, illumination between 45% and 55%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Waning Crescent</td>
                    <td>Waning, illumination below 45%</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Why Some Phases Have Fewer Days</h2>
        <p>You might notice that First Quarter and Last Quarter show very few days in the statistics. This confused me too at first. Turns out it's just how the moon works.</p>
        <p>The moon's illumination doesn't change at a constant rate. It moves slowly near new moon and full moon, but zips through the middle range quickly. The "quarter" phases, when illumination is around 50%, last only a day or two because the moon passes through that window fast.</p>
        <p>Example: In January 2026, First Quarter happened at 4:47 AM on January 26th. By that evening, illumination had already crossed 55%, pushing the classification into Waxing Gibbous. The entire First Quarter window lasted less than one calendar day.</p>
        <p>So the uneven day counts per phase are mathematically correct, even if they look odd.</p>

        <h2>Reading the Data</h2>
        <p>When you look at "Sightings by Moon Phase" on the <a href="/stats.html">statistics page</a>, keep a few things in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number in parentheses shows how many days fell into that phase so far</li>
            <li>More days in a phase means more chances to see things</li>
            <li>If you want to compare activity levels fairly, think about sightings per day, not raw totals</li>
            <li>We're still early in the project. Patterns might appear or vanish as the year goes on</li>
        </ul>
