<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This square meter plot is drying and fast. The daytime temperature is rising, the <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260130-007.html">Philippine Spinach</a> has turned yellow. </p>
<p>I saw fewer bugs in the last few days, I suspect the trend might continue into summer.</p>
<p>It has just been a few weeks, and the data of the species is already a bit messy. Double counting, mis-identified bugs, same bug logged with genus name as well as family name etc. </p>
<p>I will fix it in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This square meter plot is a battleground of life. I see relentless pursuit of survival;  each bug for its own. Brutal. Each adopted evolutionarily to be specialist in certain ways, to be efficient hunter. Poetic. </p>
<p>Well, a month went by, and here we are. I have already seen a lot. <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260114-005.html">Courting</a>, <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260124-003.html">mating</a>, <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260120-008.html">caring</a>, and <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260129-004.html">killing</a>.</p>
<p>Circle of life, eh?</p>

      <title>Week 4: Dust on the sensor</title>
      <link>https://asquaremeter.com/posts/25012026.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post5.JPG" alt="Week 4: Dust on the sensor" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>I see bugs in my dreams now.</em></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>The ant-mimicking spiders have been the highlight of this week(<a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260121-003.html">one</a>, <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260121-001.html">two</a> and <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260124-001.html">three</a>). I saw three different varieties, and each time they fooled me for a few moments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mimicry">There are incredible theories</a> about how they evolved into such convincing mimics.</p>
<p>I stepped out at night a few times this week with a headlamp to observe the plot. Night photography is really hard without the right equipment, but spotting the <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260120-005.html">paddy field frog</a> was quite nice.</p>
<p>The plot’s undergrowth is drying up, and I can now more or less see the soil easily, unlike the last few weeks. </p>
<p><img alt="The plot" src="/images/plot_week4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Another unexpected thing is that the plot is becoming an island of greenery because of all my movement around it. The immediate surrounding has become dry. I can’t think of a way to avoid this for now.</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post4.JPG" alt="Week 3: Settling in" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>Oh it's a bug's life for me</em></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>The flies from Tephritidae family have a funky dating process. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIHn8UFeVGQ">here</a>. I had to push myself a bit to record all of the footage over 3.5 hours. It was quite fascinating to see the whole thing happening. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the patch is still green, and quite a few varieties of bugs are still around. I think I have seen five or six different species that I haven't been able to get a decent picture of yet. So, fingers crossed!</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Did you know that ants do not trigger the touch-me-not plant’s defense mechanism? So cool!</p>
<p>Well, would you look at that <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/stats.html">stats page</a>, so many numbers! I think I have documented quite a lot of “resident” bugs, and now the number of new species I encounter might start to decrease. </p>

<p>If you are planning to start a similar project, make sure you do not pick a plot right below a coconut tree. The plot I selected, however, is right beneath one. The tree’s branches look like they are ready to fall at any moment. So, this bug documentation project has turned into an adventure sport!  </p>
<p>Note to self: Be graceful in your movements. Do not spook the bugs.</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

      <title>Week 1: Not bad!</title>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>So, end of the week (well, just 4 days)! 20 species found, from very tiny to slightly bigger ones!</p>
<p>I saw 3 new hoppers that I hadn't seen before. They are tiny! </p>
<p>So, the morning light is not enough to get good quality photos, I have to bump up ISO, which leads to very grainy images. Looks like I will spend monies on a flash. Sigh.</p>
<p>My macro photography skills have rusted. I am hoping it will get better as the time goes on. </p>
<p>I also discoverd a very similar project done before by Chris Helzer. <a href="https://prairieecologist.com/square-meter-photography-project/">Read about it here</a>. The photographs he has taken are very clean and precise! Now I have a benchmark to aim for!</p>
<p>One week at a time!</p>]]></description>

      <title>Day one!</title>
      <link>https://asquaremeter.com/posts/01012026.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post1.jpeg" alt="Day one!" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>So it begins.</em></p>
<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>Welcome to <code>a square meter</code> project, here we like bugs. Find more about the project in the <code>about</code> section.</p>
<p>Today, I set up the fence posts on 4 corners of <code>the patch</code>, cleaned up the space a bit, placed an old wood piece in it. That is it. No more fiddling with <code>the patch</code> for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>My first immediate dilemma is this:</p>
<p>If I spot a bug within the square meter but it moves out of the boundary before I can get a photo, should I still take the picture and count it as a sighting, or should I let it go?</p>]]></description>
