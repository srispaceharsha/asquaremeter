      <title>Week 7: It is complicated.</title>
      <link>https://asquaremeter.com/posts/15022026.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post8.JPG" alt="Week 7: It is complicated." style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>It is nice to see a bug that I hadn't seen in a while.</em></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Aphids. These tiny, plumpy bugs (~ 1 mm in length) are at the center of a dramatic relationship between various ants, ladybugs and wasps.</p>
<p><img alt="An Aphid" src="/images/aphid.jpg" /></p>
<p>It took me a good <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260202-007.html">one month</a> to even notice these tiny moving things! Now I see the drama around them everyday.</p>
<p>So, the aphids drink the plant's sap. But the sap is too sugary for aphids (I mean, no wonder they look so round!). So they secrete the excess sugar as "honeydew". So far, so good.</p>
<p>But sugar is like money of the insect world and everyone wants in.</p>
<p>The carpenter (and other types) ants "farm" these aphids for the sweet, sweet nectar. They kinda massage the aphids to "help" them secrete the honeydew. They move the aphids to juicy parts of the plant and even defend them from predators. </p>
<p><img alt="Aphids and Carpenter ant" src="/images/aphids_back_ant.JPG" /></p>
<p>I’ve seen carpenter ants climbing up and down the grass all day to tend their aphids.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I noticed these red ants (Weaver ants I guess?) doing similar rounds as well!</p>
<p><img alt="Aphids and red ant" src="/images/aphids_red_ant.JPG" /></p>
<p>Clearly, this is a profitable business. </p>
<p>But then again, more opportunistic insects thought why take the trouble for farming them, taking care of them when you can simply eat them? That's what the aptly named aphid wasps do. The other day I saw this aphid hunter running up and down the grass to select the best aphid and flying away with it!</p>
<p><img alt="Aphid wasp" src="/images/aphid_wasp.jpg" /></p>
<p>Likewise, the ladybugs munch on these aphids too. I've seen them gobbling on these aphids all day long only to be interrupted by, you guessed it, the carpenter ants. Their face-off was quite underwhelming but photographing it wasn't easy.</p>
<p><img alt="Aphids, lady bug and carpenter ant" src="/images/aphids_lady_and_ant.JPG" /></p>
<p>Such a quiet drama, all day (and night) long and all within the square meter. </p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This square meter plot is drying and fast. The daytime temperature is rising, the <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260130-007.html">Philippine Spinach</a> has turned yellow. </p>
<p>I saw fewer bugs in the last few days, I suspect the trend might continue into summer.</p>
<p>It has just been a few weeks, and the data of the species is already a bit messy. Double counting, mis-identified bugs, same bug logged with genus name as well as family name etc. </p>
<p>I will fix it in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This square meter plot is a battleground of life. I see relentless pursuit of survival;  each bug for its own. Brutal. Each adopted evolutionarily to be specialist in certain ways, to be efficient hunter. Poetic. </p>
<p>Well, a month went by, and here we are. I have already seen a lot. <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260114-005.html">Courting</a>, <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260124-003.html">mating</a>, <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260120-008.html">caring</a>, and <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260129-004.html">killing</a>.</p>
<p>Circle of life, eh?</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>The ant-mimicking spiders have been the highlight of this week(<a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260121-003.html">one</a>, <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260121-001.html">two</a> and <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260124-001.html">three</a>). I saw three different varieties, and each time they fooled me for a few moments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mimicry">There are incredible theories</a> about how they evolved into such convincing mimics.</p>
<p>I stepped out at night a few times this week with a headlamp to observe the plot. Night photography is really hard without the right equipment, but spotting the <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/sightings/20260120-005.html">paddy field frog</a> was quite nice.</p>
<p>The plot’s undergrowth is drying up, and I can now more or less see the soil easily, unlike the last few weeks. </p>
<p><img alt="The plot" src="/images/plot_week4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Another unexpected thing is that the plot is becoming an island of greenery because of all my movement around it. The immediate surrounding has become dry. I can’t think of a way to avoid this for now.</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

      <title>Week 3: Settling in</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post4.JPG" alt="Week 3: Settling in" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>Oh it's a bug's life for me</em></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>The flies from Tephritidae family have a funky dating process. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIHn8UFeVGQ">here</a>. I had to push myself a bit to record all of the footage over 3.5 hours. It was quite fascinating to see the whole thing happening. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the patch is still green, and quite a few varieties of bugs are still around. I think I have seen five or six different species that I haven't been able to get a decent picture of yet. So, fingers crossed!</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

      <title>Week 2: Ants marching</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post3.JPG" alt="Week 2: Ants marching" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>I have started talking to bugs.</em></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Did you know that ants do not trigger the touch-me-not plant’s defense mechanism? So cool!</p>
<p>Well, would you look at that <a href="https://asquaremeter.com/stats.html">stats page</a>, so many numbers! I think I have documented quite a lot of “resident” bugs, and now the number of new species I encounter might start to decrease. </p>
<p><img alt="Coconut tree" src="/images/coconut_tree.jpeg" /></p>
<p>If you are planning to start a similar project, make sure you do not pick a plot right below a coconut tree. The plot I selected, however, is right beneath one. The tree’s branches look like they are ready to fall at any moment. So, this bug documentation project has turned into an adventure sport!  </p>
<p>Note to self: Be graceful in your movements. Do not spook the bugs.</p>
<p>’Til next week!</p>]]></description>

      <title>Week 1: Not bad!</title>
      <link>https://asquaremeter.com/posts/04012026.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post2.jpeg" alt="Week 1: Not bad!" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>My knees hurt.</em></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>So, end of the week (well, just 4 days)! 20 species found, from very tiny to slightly bigger ones!</p>
<p>I saw 3 new hoppers that I hadn't seen before. They are tiny! </p>
<p>So, the morning light is not enough to get good quality photos, I have to bump up ISO, which leads to very grainy images. Looks like I will spend monies on a flash. Sigh.</p>
<p>My macro photography skills have rusted. I am hoping it will get better as the time goes on. </p>
<p>I also discoverd a very similar project done before by Chris Helzer. <a href="https://prairieecologist.com/square-meter-photography-project/">Read about it here</a>. The photographs he has taken are very clean and precise! Now I have a benchmark to aim for!</p>
<p>One week at a time!</p>]]></description>

      <title>Day one!</title>
      <link>https://asquaremeter.com/posts/01012026.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://asquaremeter.com/images/web/static/images/post1.jpeg" alt="Day one!" style="max-width:100%;"></p><p><em>So it begins.</em></p>
<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>Welcome to <code>a square meter</code> project, here we like bugs. Find more about the project in the <code>about</code> section.</p>
<p>Today, I set up the fence posts on 4 corners of <code>the patch</code>, cleaned up the space a bit, placed an old wood piece in it. That is it. No more fiddling with <code>the patch</code> for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>My first immediate dilemma is this:</p>
<p>If I spot a bug within the square meter but it moves out of the boundary before I can get a photo, should I still take the picture and count it as a sighting, or should I let it go?</p>]]></description>
